# Hello, Node.js
My first contact with Node.js

This app generates random excuses for people without imagination. If you need to skip a party or have forgotten to do your homework, you can go to this web app and it will generate a great excuse for you automatically. If you don't like the excuse it gave you, you can always press the "Generate new excuse" button or view all the excuses available on "Excuses" page.
Also, you can log in to add excuses to the database yourself.


Functionalities of this web app:
Users can register, log in, log out.
They can add excuses (title and body).
They can see other users' excuses.
They can change and delete only their own excuses.

If not logged in, you can only see the excuses and generate a random one.
